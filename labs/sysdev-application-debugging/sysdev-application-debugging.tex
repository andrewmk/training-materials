\section{Setup}

Go to the \code{$HOME/felabs-sysdev/debugging} directory.

\section{Debugging setup}

Boot your ARM board over NFS on the filesystem produced in the {\em
  Tiny embedded system} lab, with the same kernel.

\section{Setting up gdbserver and strace}

%\code{gdbserver}, \code{strace} and \code{ltrace} have already been
\code{gdbserver} and \code{strace} have already been
compiled for your target architecture as part of the cross-compiling
toolchain. Find them in the installation directory of your
toolchain. Copy these binaries to the \code{/usr/bin/} directory in
the root filesystem of your target system.

\section{Enabling job control}

In this lab, we are going to run a buggy program that keeps hanging
and crashing.  Because of this, we are going to need job control, in
particular \code{[Ctrl] [C]} allowing to interrupt a running program.

At boot time, you probably noticed that warning that job control was
turned off:

\begin{verbatim}
/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
\end{verbatim}

This happens when the shell is started in the console. The system
console cannot be used as a controlling terminal.

The fix is to start this shell in ttyO2 (the 3rd OMAP serial port on
the IGEPv2 board) by modifying the \code{/etc/inittab} file:

Replace
\begin{verbatim}
::askfirst:/bin/sh
\end{verbatim}
which implied the use of the system console device by
\begin{verbatim}
ttyO2::askfirst:/bin/sh
\end{verbatim}
to tell the \code{init} program to start the shell on \code{/dev/ttyO2}

Now reboot. You should no longer see the \code{Job control turned off}
warning, and should be able to use \code{[Ctrl] [C]}.

\section{Using strace}

\code{strace} allows to trace all the system calls made by a process:
opening, reading and writing files, starting other processes,
accessing time, etc. When something goes wrong in your application,
strace is an invaluable tool to see what it actually does, even when
you don't have the source code.

With your cross-compiling toolchain, compile the
\code{data/vista-emulator.c} program, strip it with \code{arm-linux-strip},
and copy the resulting binary to
the \code{/root} directory of the root filesystem (you might need to create
this directory if it doesn't exist yet).

\begin{verbatim}
arm-linux-gcc -o vista-emulator data/vista-emulator.c
cp vista-emulator path/to/root/filesystem/root
\end{verbatim}

Back to target system, try to run the \code{/root/vista-emulator}
program. It should hang indefinitely!

Interrupt this program by hitting \code{[Ctrl] [C]}.

Now, running this program again through the strace command and
understand why it hangs. You can guess it without reading the source
code!

Now add what the program was waiting for, and now see your program
proceed to another bug, failing with a segmentation fault.

%\section{Using ltrace}

%Try to run the program through \code{ltrace}. You will see that
%another library is required to run this utility. Find this library in
%the toolchain and add it to your root filesystem again.

%Now, ltrace should run fine and you should see what the program does:
%it tries to consume as much system memory as it can!

\section{Using gdbserver}

We are now going to use \code{gdbserver} to understand why the program
segfaults.

Compile \code{vista-emulator.c} again with the \code{-g} option to
include debugging symbols. This time, just keep it on your workstation,
as you already have the version without debugging symbols on your target.

Then, on the target side, run \code{vista-emulator} under
\code{gdbserver}. gdbserver will listen on a TCP port for a connection
from GDB, and will control the execution of vista-emulator according
to the GDB commands:

\begin{verbatim}
gdbserver localhost:2345 vista-emulator
\end{verbatim}

On the host side, run \code{arm-linux-gdb} (also found in your toolchain):
\begin{verbatim}
arm-linux-gdb vista-emulator
\end{verbatim}

You can also start the debugger through the \code{ddd} interface:
\begin{verbatim}
ddd --debugger arm-linux-gdb vista-emulator
\end{verbatim}

GDB starts and loads the debugging information from the
\code{vista-emulator} binary that has been compiled with \code{-g}.

Then, we need to tell where to find our libraries, since they are not
present in the default \code{/lib} and \code{/usr/lib} directories on
your workstation. This is done by setting GDB \code{sysroot} variable
(on one line):

\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) set sysroot /usr/local/xtools/arm-unknown-linux-uclibcgnueabi/
arm-unknown-linux-uclibcgnueabi/sysroot/
\end{verbatim}

And tell gdb to connect to the remote system:
\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) target remote <target-ip-address>:2345
\end{verbatim}

Then, use \code{gdb} as usual to set breakpoints, look at the source
code, run the application step by step, etc. Graphical versions of
gdb, such as \code{ddd} can also be used in the same way. In our case,
we'll just start the program and wait for it to hit the segmentation
fault:
\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) continue
\end{verbatim}

You could then ask for a backtrace to see where this happened:
\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) backtrace
\end{verbatim}

This will tell you that the segmentation fault occurred in a function
of the C library, called by our program. This should help you in
finding the bug in our application.

\section{What to remember}

During this lab, we learned that...
\begin{itemize}
\item Compiling an application for the target system is very similar
  to compiling an application for the host, except that the
  cross-compilation introduces a few complexities when libraries are
  used.

\item It's easy to study the behavior of programs and diagnose issues
%  without even having the source code, thanks to strace and ltrace.
  without even having the source code, thanks to strace.

\item You can leave a small \code{gdbserver} program (300 KB) on your target
  that allows to debug target applications, using a standard GDB
  debugger on the development host.

\item It is fine to strip applications and binaries on the target
  machine, as long as the programs and libraries with debugging
  symbols are available on the development host.

\end{itemize}
